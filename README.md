# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

"In this project, I recreated the Apple website using modern web development techniques. The site features smooth animations powered by React hooks and GSAP, delivering a seamless user experience. I integrated Three.js to showcase a 3D model of the iPhone, adding an interactive element that brings the product to life. One of the major challenges I faced was designing the hero section, where I implemented a custom animated progress bar for videos. The progress bar dynamically updates as the video plays, enhancing the overall visual appeal and user interaction."
